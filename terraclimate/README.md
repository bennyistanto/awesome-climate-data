# TerraClimate

[TerraClimate](http://www.climatologylab.org/terraclimate.html) is a dataset of monthly climate and climatic water balance for global terrestrial surfaces from 1958-2020. These data provide important inputs for ecological and hydrological studies at global scales that require high spatial resolution and time-varying data. All data have monthly temporal resolution and a 4-km (1/24th degree) spatial resolution. 

## Datasets

**Primary Climate Variables:** Maximum temperature, minimum temperature, vapor pressure, precipitation accumulation, downward surface shortwave radiation, wind-speed

**Derived variables:** Reference evapotranspiration (ASCE Penman-Montieth), Runoff, Actual Evapotranspiration, Climate Water Deficit, Soil Moisture, Snow Water Equivalent, Palmer Drought Severity Index, Vapor pressure deficit

## Repo

This repo provide links for individual data that extracted and categorized from http://thredds.northwestknowledge.net:8080/thredds/catalog/TERRACLIMATE_ALL/catalog.html
